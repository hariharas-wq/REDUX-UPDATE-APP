## Introduction

Redux is a popular state management library used primarily with React applications. This project serves as a minimalistic example of how Redux can be implemented to manage application state. The app allows users to perform two main actions:

1. **Deposit Funds**: Add a specified amount to the balance.
2. **Withdraw Funds**: Subtract a specified amount from the balance.

By performing these actions, users can see how Redux helps manage the application's state and ensure data consistency.

## Features

- Update the balance by depositing or withdrawing funds.
- Redux-based state management for a predictable and centralized application state.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for balance updates.


## Usage

Once you have the application running, use the following steps to update the balance:

1. Click the "+" or "-" button.
2. The balance will be updated accordingly, and you will see the new balance displayed on the screen.

## Redux Overview

Redux is a state management library that helps manage the state of your application in a predictable way. In this project, Redux is used to manage the balance state. Key Redux concepts used in this project include:

- **Store**: The single source of truth for the application's state.
- **Actions**: Events that describe changes in the application's state.
- **Reducers**: Functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
- **Dispatch**: A method used to send actions to the store to update the state.

This project demonstrates how Redux can simplify state management and make it more maintainable, even in a small-scale application.
